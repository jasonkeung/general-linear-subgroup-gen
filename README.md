# general-linear-subgroup-gen
Quick minimum subgroup generator given an element for the 2x2 general linear group over Z_p for a prime p.
# Usage
With Python installed, run the python file through a terminal.
```
python3 <path>/subgroupGen.py
```
Follow the prompts and enter a prime number such as 11 to use Z_p.
Ordinary matrix multiplication will be used.
Enter the starting element for the subgroup in a left-right top-down manner.
For example, to enter the identity element for GL(Z_3), enter 1, 0, 0, and 1 sequentially.
